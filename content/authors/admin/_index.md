Hello! I'm a first-year PhD student at the Bioengineering department in [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), under the guidance of [Dr. Pedro Ballester](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/p.ballester) ([about our group](https://ballestergroup.github.io/)). Prior to beginning my PhD, I completed my Masters at the University of Edinburgh, where I collaborated with Dr. Diego Oyarzún on machine learning applications for Phenotypic Drug Discovery. I received my Bachelor's degree from China University of Geosciences. My current research focuses on leveraging Artificial Intelligence for Phenotypic Virtual Screening, with the goal of making noteworthy advancements in the field of drug discovery. I have a strong interest in developing innovative computational approaches that can expedite the identification of potential drug candidates for various diseases.
