As a student studying biology and bioinformatics, I've always benefited from and been intrigued by the magic of big data. I had a taste of applying machine learning analysis in research projects and started being attracted by Bioinformatics during my undergraduate studies. I continued this interest in my graduate studies using bioinformatic tools to tackle biological problems, where I appreciated the efficiency of programming and developed my passion for diving deeper into machine learning, especially the deep learning area.
