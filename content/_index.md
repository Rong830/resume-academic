              Deep learning in phenotypic drug discovery against glioblastoma cells. Supervised by Dr. Diego Oyarz√∫n, Dr. Vanessa Smer-Barreto.

              * Aim: Machine learning approaches for discovering novel chemicals that change the morphology of Glioblastoma cells. 
              * Method: Developed and optimized a graph neural network for feature extraction combining information from RDkit and features extracted  a large pre-trained language model (ChemBERTa). Improved model architecture and metrics, particularly for imbalanced data.

              Neosinocalamus growth prediction using image data

              The aim of this study was to analyze the connection between growth and development of Neosinocalamus affinis with the cells' structure and components at the molecular level. The leaves from Neosinocalamus affinis were collected and processed. K-means clustering was applied to the mean size and number of each phytolith from different positions of leaves from different ages. The study discovered the correlation between the size and numbers of phytolith and the growth of the affinis, which could be used to predict the age and living environment of plants sample collected from fossil.
